# Key pair

To receive encrypted messages using public key cryptography  (and to reliably inform others that a message genuinely came from you), you need to create two keys. One, the private key, you keep secret. The other, the public key, you can let anyone see. The two keys are connected mathematically, and are often collectively known as a "key pair".
