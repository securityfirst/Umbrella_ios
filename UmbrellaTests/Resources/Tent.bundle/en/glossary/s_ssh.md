# SSH

SSH (or Secure SHell) is a method for letting you securely control a remote computer via a command line interface. One of the features of the SSH protocol is that as well as sending commands, you can also use it to securely relay Internet traffic between two computers. To set up an ssh link, the remote system needs to operate as a ssh server, and your local machine need an ssh client program.
