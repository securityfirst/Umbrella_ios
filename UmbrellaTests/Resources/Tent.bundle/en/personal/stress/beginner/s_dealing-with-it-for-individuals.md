Stress management is an individual process. There is no formula.

_It is impossible to take care of others if you do not take care of yourself._

Try to have contact with others outside of the work environment.

## Be informed.

## Talk to people. 

Sharing a problem with others may help you find a solution and will make you feel less isolated. 

Keep a journal or write letters if you can't talk to others.

Refuse to see yourself as helpless or a victim of circumstance. 

When a situation causes you stress:

*	Identify the problem and brainstorm a solution.

*   **Think positive!**
