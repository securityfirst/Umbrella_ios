title: Operating in Warzones

Human rights defenders requiring body armor should choose a vest according to the expected threat. The U.S. National Institute of Justice has developed a six-tier rating system used by most manufacturers around the world. If you are covering armed conflict, you should choose a vest rated to stop high-velocity bullets fired by military rifles. Be aware, however, that no vest is completely bulletproof. One may still be severely injured or die from the trauma of blunt impact, even if the body armor does stop the projectile. Consider gender-specific designs and whether you require options such as side or groin protectors.

Helmets are also recommended for journalists or humanitarian workers in war zones. Recognise, however, that even a top- rated helmet mainly provides protection against shrapnel, and is likely to be penetrated by any direct hit from a bullet fired by an assault or sniper rifle.

Kevlar ballistic material can often suffer damage which cannot be seen by the naked eye. For example, if plates are dropped from a height. Damage can weaken the ability of the material to protect from ballistic threats. As such, you should ensure that any ballistic material is inspected by a trained professional before use.
