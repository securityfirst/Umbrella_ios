Protective gear is also available in situations of civil unrest. Lightweight and relatively thin anti-stab vests can provide protection against knife attacks, rubber bullets, and other hazards. Baseball-style caps with metal plates are also available. Gas masks may also be worn, although in doing so journalists or humanitarian workers incur the risk that they could be mistaken for either riot police or demonstrators.
