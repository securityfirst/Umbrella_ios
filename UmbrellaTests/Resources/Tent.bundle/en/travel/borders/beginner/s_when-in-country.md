# Don't leave a paper trail 

If your are searched, sensitive paper could expose information you are trying to protect.

Sensitive paper could include: 

*   Receipts, tickets, and bills that document your activity. 

*   Handwritten notes. 

*   Business cards or publications from people you meet.

## Avoid paper: 

*	Photograph receipts you need for your records and destroy the originals. 

*	When meeting people, ask for digital publications, links, or emails instead of paper.

(Learn about [meetings](umbrella://lesson/meetings).)

## Secure your notes: 

*   Create codes that only you understand to obscure names or other sensitive information. Don't undermine codewords with other, easily identifiable information.

*   Separate sensitive information. For example, number interview notes in your notebook, and securely store the names and locations corresponding to each number in another location.

*	Type up, or photograph notes. Encrypt the files. 

(Learn about [protecting files](umbrella://lesson/protecting-files).)

## Destroy sensitive paper: 

*	Don't delay. You might forget or give someone the chance to see or photograph the information.

*	Go somewhere unexpected. Cleaners or security staff may retrieve waste from your hotel or office.

*	Soak notes in water to make them unreadable.

# Take simple precautions

## Don't chat.

*   Minimise the amount of information you share during meetings and other interactions. 

*	Casual, social queries may be overheard or staged to elicit information.

*   Advise hotel staff not to share information about you.

*Be aware they could be monitoring you.*

## Don't be obvious.

*   Travel by different routes at different times.

*   Agree a signal to alert your team to danger. 

*Choose something easy to do that would not happen accidentally.*

## Use common sense.

*   Avoid walking alone or at night.

*   Always wear a seatbelt.
