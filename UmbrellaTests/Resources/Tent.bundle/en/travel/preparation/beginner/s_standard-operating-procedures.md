Standard operating procedures are step-by-step instructions for any scenario.  

Establish these before your trip and share them with your team. 

# 1. The plan

## Itinerary 
*   Create a schedule of travel, meetings, and events. 

If required, inform authorities or embassies of your travel plans.

(Learn how to prepare for sensitive [meetings](umbrella://lesson/meetings).)

*	Create a communication schedule. 

Check in regularly with someone who is not travelling with you and can provide support if you fail to check in due to an emergency.

*   Establish curfews, deadlines, and no-go areas. 

*	Arrange to be met on arrival in insecure locations or high-crime areas like airports and stations. 

In order of preference, choose:

*	Someone you know;
*	A pre-booked service including driver name and vehicle registration (check identification);
*	Official taxi with a meter.

*Risks of local taxis vary by country.*

## Information security 
*    Prepare a cover story for airports and elsewhere. 

(Learn about [borders](umbrella://lesson/borders) and [checkpoints](umbrella://lesson/checkpoints).)

*   Only carry information you really need.  

	* Delete non-essential information from devices.  
	* Back up information securely before travel.
    * Carry sensitive information securely.

Consider: 
*	Cash;
*	Key documents;
*	Emergency names and contact information;
*	Reputable hotels or other emergency destinations.

**Carry your constant companion on your person at all times.**
