## Contacts

*   Programme essential contact information into your device, but not sensitive numbers.

*	Try to memorize emergency phone numbers. 
*   Store essential numbers separate from your device in case it is lost or stolen. Use code words where necessary.
*	Store sensitive contact information securely. 
*	If you really need to add sensitive contact information to your device in a hurry, create notes or reminders instead of the phone book. Disguise phone numbers and use code words where necessary.

*Note numbers as dates, measurements, coordinates, quantities on a shopping list, or another formulation.*
