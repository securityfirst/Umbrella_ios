Accidents can be minimized, but not avoided entirely. 

Mishandled accidents may escalate into a security risk, even violence or threats of retribution.

## When involved in an accident:

*   Check you are safe. 

Quickly discern the attitudes and actions of people around the accident site. Ensure that you are not at risk by staying.

*   If you are safe, do not leave the site.

*If your safety is jeopardized, drive to a nearby police station, military post, or your local office.*

*   Make the site safe and visible to other traffic.

*   Provide care and assistance as appropriate.

*   Contact and cooperate with local authorities as appropriate.

*   Contact your team or support network.

(Create a communication schedule with someone who can provice support in an emergency in [preparation](umbrella://lesson/preparation).)

*   If feasible, take pictures of the site.

*	If feasible, record names and contact information of witnesses, responding authorities, and those involved.

## When approaching another accident site: 

*	Consider safety and security.

*	Take care not to become involved in a second accident while responding.
