# Drivers

*   Brief drivers about safe driving procedures before travel;
*   Consider the driver's identity or ethnicity could put them at risk in insecure areas. 

# Vehicles

## Choose the vehicle

*   Will the trip be urban or rural? 
*	What is the state of the roads? Is a 4x4 necessary?
*   Is the vehicle desirable for car-jackers?

## Check the vehicle

*   Tyres;
*   Seatbelts;
*   Fuel;
*   Brakes;
*   Oil;
*   Steering;
*   Loading.

## Prepare the vehicle

*   If you are driving a work vehicle, decide if you are travelling high or low profile.

		* Displaying a logo or driving an official vehicle may protect you in some cases (high profile). 			* Concealing your logo and blending in may protect you in other cases (low profile). 

*   Consider posting a decal indicating guns are not permitted in the vehicle.

*   Avoid transporting sensitive documents or equipment in areas prone to banditry. 

*	Arrange permits to transport items that could be interpreted as useful to combatants or terrorists.
