## Plan your schedule

*	Consider the length of the journey. Do you need more than one driver?

*   Schedule prayer or food stops as necessary.

*   Notify others of travel times, destinations, and steps they should take if you are late.

*   Create a communications schedule to check in regularly.

(Learn about communications schedules and other standard operating procedures in [preparation](umbrella://lesson/preparation).)

*   In insecure locations, arrange to be met on arrival by someone carrying identification.

*   Vary the time and route of regular journeys.  

*If criminals can predict where you will be and when, it is easier for them to target you.*
