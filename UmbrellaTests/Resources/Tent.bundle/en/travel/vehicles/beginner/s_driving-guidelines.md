## Parked cars

## Avoid passengers

Passengers: 
  *	May not be covered by insurance;
  * May violate organisational policies if you are driving for work;
  *	May represent a security risk;
  *	May damage perceptions of you and your work. 

*Travelling with armed or uniformed personnel may imply that you are working together and compromise your independence.*

## Don't risk your life

*	If threatened, provide transportation. 
*	In the event of an attempted carjacking, you should not risk your life to save a vehicle.

## Create a transportation policy

A transportation policy should include these, and other specific guidelines for your needs. 

The goal of the policy is to ensure:  

*	Vehicles are maintained; 
*	Journeys are planned; 
*	Vehicle users are prepared to respond to a range of possible incidents.
