# Are checkpoints legitimate?

Legitimate checkpoints generally have a purpose, like monitoring traffic or preventing weapons from entering an area. 

Others are designed to harass people, or provide cover for ambush, theft or violence. 

## Rapid assessment questions

*   Where it is located?
*   Who is manning it?
*   How is their mood?
*   Are there signs of trouble?

Checkpoints manned by regular army and police forces may be less problematic than ones manned by irregulars.

## Standard locations to expect checkpoints: 

*	Crossroads; 
*	Bridges;
*	Mountain passes;
*	Town entrances and exits. 

**Be cautious of remove checkpoints away from habitation.** 

## Don't take a risk

If you suspect that there is a risk of violence or other serious problems, **turn round and drive steadily away if it is safe to do so.**
