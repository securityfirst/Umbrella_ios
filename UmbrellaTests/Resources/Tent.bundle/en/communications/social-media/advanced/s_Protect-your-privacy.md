# For yourself 

## Domain name registration
When you register a domain name, your contact information is made public. This is a transparency requirement in many countries. 

*	Use a work address and phone number or one that does not reveal your home location. 
* 	Create an email account exclusively for managing the domain.

*Note: Domain proxy services which offer to protect privacy for a fee have proven unreliable in the face of legal or public pressure to reveal registry information.*

## Public contact details

*	Don’t post your email address. 
* 	Create a contact form where people can submit THEIR information in order to contact you. 
* 	If you are a journalist with a public email address, talk to your employer about a system that will filter out abusive emails.

## Protect your location. 
*	Don't post information that can be used to identify your exact location, including your hotel and where you plan to eat.

## Consider blogging anonymously. 

Some bloggers use a pseudonym or write under a variation of their name.

## Familiarise yourself with policies, terms of service or community guidelines.

*	Internet service providers (ISPs) and other services should have policies that prohibit hate speech and protect your privacy. Some online platforms include gender in their policies against hate speech. 

*	If necessary, switch to a provider that is more responsive to user privacy concerns and complaints.

*	When someone violates the terms, report them.

(Secure your accounts with [strong passwords] (umbrella://lesson/passwords/0) and [2FA.] (umbrella://lesson/passwords/1))

## Establish a comments policy. 

*	Approve comments before publication.

*	Require people to create accounts in order to post comments. 

* 	Activate the option to track IP addresses of commenters.

*	Delete comments that overstep the boundaries of your established criteria, or report them to the relevant editor or publisher. 

*	Ensure media outlets you write for have commenting policies that do not allow hate speech, and that they have protocols in place for dealing with it. 

* 	Consider closing the comments section on certain pieces or removing comment sections altogether if hate speech is a problem. 

## Reach out.

*	Enlist friends and colleagues to unpublish hateful comments. 

*	Encourage your support network to tweet or post support for you whenever they notice hate speech on your social media accounts.

# Help others 

Create policies to help your team protect themselves from hate speech.
