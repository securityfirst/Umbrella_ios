title: Hate speech
---
Hate speech is an inexact term, but is understood to refer to discrimination, harassment, threats or violence against a person or group on the basis of their gender, disability, sexual orientation, race, or identity. 

Hate speech may be written, spoken or visual.

Examples include:

*	Speech that trivialises, glorifies or incites violence against women. 
*	Speech that trivialises the Holocaust. 
*	Speech that glorifies attacks on people because of their race.

## Hate speech is not free speech

*	People of all backgrounds have a right to use their voices and to express themselves however they want. Hate speech is a violation of this right. 

*	Many of the same people committing such violence are very vocal about their own right to free speech, ignoring how their attacks restrict the free speech of others. 

*	Freedom of expression does not trump freedom from violence. If abuse is expressed in a particularly aggressive, inflammatory or sustained manner, then it may be considered hate speech.
