# Use HTTPS

Look for http:// at the start of the web address before you access social media sites. 

HTTPS is the secure version of the HTTP protocol used to access websites. It encrypts your communications so that they cannot be read by other people on the network.

Using https:// stops people from intercepting your username, password and any other information you post. 

(Use HTTPS whenever you use the [Internet](umbrella://lesson/the-internet/0). and send [email](umbrella://lesson/email/0).) 

Never access social media from:

*	A device or a network that you don't trust; 
*	A device that could host malware;
*	A public computer that may store your password or browsing history.
