Sites like Facebook, Google+, and Twitter are some of the most popular on the Internet, with hundreds of millions of users each. 

Many people use them for professional as well as personal reasons, to communicate, publish, coordinate, and persuade. 

This means we're sharing a lot about ourselves online, usually more than we realise. 

This can put us, our operations, or our contacts at risk.
