# Withhold information

Information mined from your social media accounts can be used to impersonate or attack you and your contacts.

## Your name.

*   Consider whether to use your real name or not. Could your activity result in legal, physical, or social consequences? Are you willing to accept the risk? 

*   Consider creating separate social media accounts and pseudonyms for different activities. 

*Note: Check the site's policy. For example, Facebook [requires] (https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576?helpref=faq_content) users to go by "the name they go by in everyday life." Many interpret this broadly or ignore it, but an adversary could potentially [report] (https://www.facebook.com/help/1216349518398524?helpref=hc_global_nav) a pseudonymous account for "pretending to be something or someone that doesn't exist."*

## Nonessential information.

*   Don't provide details like your birthday, phone number, and employment details just because the site asks for it. 

## Your email address.

*   If you are concerned with hiding your identity, create a separate email address for social media use. 

The social media site may still log your IP address, which can reveal your location. Use a VPN or the Tor Browser to disguise your location.

# Secure your account

Social media accounts can be hijacked, and fake accounts may be used to spread malware. 

## Use a strong password. 

*   Add 2FA where available. Change your password regularly.

## Answer security questions randomly.

Many social media sites use security questions to confirm your identity if you forget your password. 

*	Invent answers and store the answers in a password manager.

## Engage wisely

Attackers may befriend you to spy on your network or spread malware using social engineering. 

*   Only connect to people you know personally and trust. 

*	Be cautious of links and attachments, especially in direct messages.
