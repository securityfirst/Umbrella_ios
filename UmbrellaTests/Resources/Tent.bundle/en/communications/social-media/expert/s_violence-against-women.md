title: Violence against woman
---
Nearly a quarter of women from eight countries surveyed by Amnesty International in [2017] (https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/11/amnesty-reveals-alarming-impact-of-online-abuse-against-women/) said they had experienced online abuse or harassment at least once.

Of those women, 41% said these online experiences made them feel that their physical safety was threatened. 

## Online abuse is often used to silence women. 

Preventing online violence against women is not in opposition to free speech, but rather in line with it.

For example, if you're silenced primarily because of a private demonstration of sexuality, the blackmailers are trying to punish or control you using the censure and shame our patriarchal societies put on women and their naked bodies. 

Women have a right to be sexual; when we stop shaming women's sexuality, so-called 'revenge porn' will diminish in power.

> *"[Anonymous online harassment] discourages women from writing and earning a living online. It interferes with their professional lives. It brands them as incompetent workers and inferior sexual objects."* Danielle Keats Citron, US lawyer
