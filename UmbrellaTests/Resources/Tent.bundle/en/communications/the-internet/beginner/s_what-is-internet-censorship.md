title: What is Internet Censorship?
---
Many governments, companies, schools, and public access points prevent Internet users from accessing certain information.

This is a form of censorship.

Depending on the method used, Internet censorship can affect: 

*	Websites or pages;
*	Keywords or images; 
*	Search results;
*	Social media platforms like Facebook;
*	Messaging apps like WhatsApp. 

Combat censorship with circumvention or appeal.
