HTTPS is the secure version of the HTTP protocol used to access websites. 

## HTTPS for circumvention

Censors may only block sites using HTTP. 

1.	Look for http:// at the start of the web address.
2.	Reload the site with https:// instead. 

## HTTPS Everywhere

HTTPS stops censors from reading web traffic and detecting keywords, making individual web pages harder to block. Censors can still detect and block domain names like Facebook.com. 

* 	Download the [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) browser add-on for Firefox or Chrome to automatically use HTTPS wherever it is supported.
