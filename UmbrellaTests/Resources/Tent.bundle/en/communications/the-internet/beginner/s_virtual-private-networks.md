A virtual private network (VPN) encrypts Internet data sent from your device to disguise your location. 

If a website or service is blocked in your location, a VPN helps you access it from a different location. 

A VPN:

1.	Relays your data to another network in an encrypted package; 
2.	Unpacks and decrypts the data;
3.	Sends it on. 

Your request for information appears to come from the other network, which may be operated by a VPN provider, or your employer. 

*	A proxy only works for blocked websites, and does not encrypt your traffic; 
*	A VPN works for blocked email, VoIP and other services as well as websites, and encrypts your traffic. 

## Are VPNs really private? 

> * Tools that promise privacy or security are not always private or secure. And tools that use terms like “anonymizer” do not always keeps your identity completely secret.*

A VPN protects your traffic from being intercepted by third parties, including your internet service provider. 

But the VPN provider can intercept your traffic directly, and record what you do online. Third parties, including government or law enforcement officials, may still be able to access this information through the VPN provider. 

Whether this is a problem for you will depend on your threat model.

VPN providers may be commercial or non-profit, hosted in different countries, and offer different privacy policies. For information about specific VPN services, click [here]. (https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-section/)
