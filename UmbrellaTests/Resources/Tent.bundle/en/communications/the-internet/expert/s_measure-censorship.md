# Run a test

Testing your network helps to collect evidence of censorship. 

Two organisations, Netblocks and OONI, can detect disruptions to normal internet traffic due to censorship using tests by you and others on your network. 

These tests require you to turn off your VPN and undermine your anonymity. 

(Learn more about this in [Internet advanced](umbrella://lesson/the-internet/1).) 

_Anyone monitoring your internet activity would be able to see that you are running these tests._

Whether this is a problem for you will depend on your threat model.

(Learn more about this in [managing information.] (umbrella://lesson/managing-information))

### Close all browser tabs and other applications before turning your VPN off.

## NetBlocks

NetBlocks is a research organisation that monitors network disruptions and shutdowns. 

*	Click on [https://netblocks.org/scan/](https://netblocks.org/scan/) to scan your network directly from your browser. The tool will report the data back to NetBlocks for analysis.

## OONI

The Open Observatory Network Initiative (OONI) collects network measurements to detect Internet censorship and traffic manipulation. It is a free software project under the Tor Project. 

(Learn more about this in [Internet advanced](umbrella://lesson/the-internet/1).) 

OONI provides tools to test your network, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Telegram, or specific websites.
