If a government or company censors the Internet, documenting and measuring it helps others understand the problem and fight back. 

# Document

*	What you were trying to access;
*	The time and date;
*	The company that provides your internet service;
*	The device you use;
*	Screenshots of the error screen showing a page is offline;
*	Any other information you think would be helpful.
