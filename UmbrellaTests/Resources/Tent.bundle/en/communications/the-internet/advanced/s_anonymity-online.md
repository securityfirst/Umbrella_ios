Accessing the Internet and publishing information on the Internet leaves traces.

## These traces can reveal: 

*	Who you are;
*	Where you are;
*	What you are doing. 

This may put you at risk. 

(Learn to assess your risk in the [managing information.] (umbrella://lesson/managing-information) lesson.)

You can reduce your risk by using Tor. 

**Remember, these tools can only protect your anonymity if you do not log in to sites or post something online that could identify you!**
