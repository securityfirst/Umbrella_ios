title: Public Key Encryption
---
PGP is based on a cryptographic system called public key encryption. 

## Everyone using it has two keys.

1.	A public key that everyone knows;
2.	A private key only you know. 

For example: 

1. 	You encrypt a message for me using my public key; 
2. 	I decrypt it with my private key.

## Use PGP to: 

* 	Encrypt email for anyone, as long as you have their public key.

*   Stop anyone else from reading your email.

(You can also use keys to sign email and verify someone else's signature.) 

## Protect your private key. 

If someone else gets your private key, they can read emails intended for you, and pretend to be you.

*	Store your private key somewhere safe.

*	Protect your private key with a strong password.
