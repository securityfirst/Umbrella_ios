title: 'What PGP Can''t Do: Metadata'
---
# Metadata is very revealing

PGP keeps email *content* private, but reveals everything else about the email. 

This metadata includes: 

*	The subject line; 
*	The recipient; 
*	When you sent the message.

If you email a political dissident, what you say might not matter. You may be flagged just for communicating with them. 

Using an additional tool like the Tor browser will help you limit the amount of metadata you expose. 

(Learn more about Tor in the [Internet lesson](umbrella://lesson/the-internet).)

# Encryption may be a red flag

In some countries, encryption software could expose you to accusations of criminal activity or espionage; or refusing to decrypt messages may be illegal. Think carefully about whether it is appropriate for you.
