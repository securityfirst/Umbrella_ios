title: Switching to a more secure email account
---
# Choose a secure provider

Some webmail accounts provide a secure connection while you log in to protect your password, but don't protect your messages. Some also include your computer's IP address in emails. 

Even when you send email using HTTPS, your email provider still gets an unencrypted copy of your communication. Government and law enforcement officials may be able to access this data.

## Gmail

Google offers some security features, but it's not recommended for sensitive email. 

*	Gmail accounts use a secure connection and don't reveal your IP address to email recipients. 
*	However, Google scans and records email content for a variety of purposes and has conceded to the demands of governments that restrict digital freedom in the past.
*	Always turn on 2-step verification, a kind of two-factor authentication (2FA). Setting it up is [simple](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en).

(Learn about 2FA in 
[Passwords Advanced](umbrella://lesson/passwords/1).) 

## Protonmail and Tutanota

[Protonmail](https://protonmail.com) and [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com) offer free email accounts with strong privacy policies. 

Emails between users of the same service are encrypted end-to-end, so the provider can't read them.

## RiseUp

RiseUp [https://mail.riseup.net](https://mail.riseup.net) offers free email to activists, strong privacy policies, and a commitment to protect information on their servers.  

To create a RiseUp account: 
*	Ask two existing users for an invite code; or,
*	Tell RiseUp about yourself and they may give you access.
