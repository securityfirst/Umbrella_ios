# Basic protection 

Only the recipient should be able to read your email.

Other people can intercept unencrypted communications sent over your web browser, including sites you visit and email content.

These could include:

*	People using the same Wi-Fi in an airport or café; 
*	People at your office or school; 
*	Your internet service provider; 
*	Malicious hackers; 
*	Government or law enforcement officials. 

## What is HTTPS? 

HTTPS, (also known as SSL or TLS), encrypts your communications so that they cannot be read by other people on the network. Make sure your webmail supports HTTPS. 

## "S" for Secure

To find out, look for https:// (not http://) at the start of the web address: https://mail.google.com. 

Even if your webmail uses HTTPS by default (they should): 

*	Always check for https:// before logging in. If you only see http://, add "s" and refresh the page. 

* 	Download the [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) browser add-on for Firefox or Chrome.
