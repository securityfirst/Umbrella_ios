title: What to do if your email is hacked
---
# Act fast.

## Reclaim your account. 

Contact your email provider to re-establish access if you are locked out.

## Stop using the account.

At least until you understand the situation.

## Change your passwords and security questions.

Choose new, strong passwords for your email and all linked accounts. Linked accounts use your email to log in, recover login information, or verify your identity.  

(Use [strong passwords] (umbrella://lesson/passwords/0) and [2FA.] (umbrella://lesson/passwords/1))

## Secure your devices

Any device you use to access email from the compromised account is vulnerable. Scan your computer for [malware](umbrella://lesson/malware/0) and refresh your [mobile phone] ((umbrella://lesson/mobile-phones/0) security.

(Learn [basic security for Android](umbrella://lesson/android) and how to [encrypt your iPhone] (umbrella://lesson/encrypt-your-iphone).)

## Check account settings and activity.

Attackers with access to your account may try to: 

*	Circulate malware in links or attachments;
*	Spy on you by forwarding or copying messages;
* 	Steal or destroy saved email;
*	Impersonate or discredit you.

Review all settings for signs of this activity. Include folders, signatures, away messages, display name, and filters.

## Debrief.

How was your account compromised? Was your password broken? Were you tricked into installing malware? The more you understand the attack, the better you can respond.

## Alert your community.

Determine what sensitive information and contacts may be exposed and inform those affected. Share information to prevent others from falling victim to a similar attack.  
 
## Report the attack. 

If appropriate for your situation and threat model, inform your email provider or law enforcement.  
 
## Switch software.

Consider free, open-source email software like Thunderbird. 

(Learn about open-source software in [Malware Advanced] ([malware](umbrella://lesson/malware/1) and how to add encryption in [Email Advanced.] (umbrella://lesson/email/1)) 

## Switch provider.

If appropriate, consider switching email providers to one with strong privacy policies hosted in another country.
 
## Change your passwords. 
 
Seriously. After upgrading your security, change your passwords. Again.
