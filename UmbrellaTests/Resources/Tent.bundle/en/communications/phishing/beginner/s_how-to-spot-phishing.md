title: How to Spot Phishing
---
Web browsers and mail services can detect some phishing attempts. If you see a warning about a suspicious website or message, don't ignore it!   

But not all attacks will be detected. Learn to recognise a phishing attempt for yourself by checking the following in your incoming messages:

## The "From" field. 

	* Who is the message supposed to be from? Is it really their account, or could it be a trick? 
	* Is the spelling, image or format of the sender's account or email address what you would expect? Mistakes or variations are a red flag. 
	* Emails can be forged to display a false return address, so don't rely on this to rule out phishing attempts.  

## The "To" field.

	* Was the message sent to you personally, and does it address you by name? A sender you know probably would.  
	* Were you included on a message sent to a large group? Attackers often send messages to multiple people, looking for those who don't know better or aren't paying attention. 
	* Learn to identify targeted attacks under [How to spot Spear Phishing] (umbrella//lesson/phishing/how-to-spot-spear-phishing). 
 
## The content. 

	* Is the grammar, layout or language in the message what you would 
	expect? Mistakes or variations are a red flag.
	* Does it ask for personal information? 
	* Does it offer you 
	something attractive, or warn you to act immediately to prevent disaster? Attackers hope your emotional response will override common sense.

## Links or attachments. 
	* Does the message contain anything that you weren't expecting, like a file or link to a photo of you sent out of the blue? Attackers want you to take action by clicking on something. 
	* Links could look like a button or an image instead of a web address. Be wary of unexpected invitations to view documents in services like Google Drive or Dropbox, even if they look official.
