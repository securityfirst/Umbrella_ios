Phishing attacks try to trick people into revealing information or downloading malware that can be used to spy on them or disrupt their work.

A phishing message pretends to be trustworthy in order to get you to do something, like: 

*	Click on a link;
*	Open an attachment;
*	Install software;
*	Enter your login credentials. 

Phishing messages can be sent by email, SMS, social media or chat services, including Skype, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, or WhatsApp. 

## Spear phishing

Spear phishing attacks use personal information about their target audience to make the message more convincing. 

You are more likely to click on a bad link if it looks like your boss sent it, or enter your bank details into a form that appears to belong to your bank.

The bad news is that phishing campaigns are cheap and easy to run. The good news is that they are not usually sophisticated. They rely on you to make simple, preventable mistakes.
