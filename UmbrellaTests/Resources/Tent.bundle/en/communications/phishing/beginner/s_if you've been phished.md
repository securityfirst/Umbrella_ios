title: If you've been Phished
---
If you catch a phishing attack before you click:

* Nice one! 
* Warn the supposed sender through another channel that an attacker is impersonating them. 
* Warn your team, your community, IT support, or account provider as needed. 
* Report the attack to an IT or security expert before you delete the message. They may need it to learn more about the attackers.
* Delete the message. 

If you click on a link or attachment carrying malware: 

*   Disconnect from the Internet and stop using your device.
*   Find a clean device.  
*   Change your passwords. Any password that you entered on your computer while it was infected should be considered compromised. If you haven't already, turn on [two factor authentication] (umbrella://glossary/two-factor-authentication) for all your accounts.
*   Warn your contacts that your accounts may be compromised. 
*   Report the attack. An IT or security expert may be able to learn more about the attackers and warn others. Umbrella includes a [digital security incident] (umbrella://forms/digital-security-incident) form to help you share key information about what happened. 
*   Consider reinstalling the operating system (eg Windows, Android, IOS) on your device. This will remove most malware, but some sophisticated variants may persist.
*   If you need further help, seek [Emergency Support] (umbrella://lesson/emergency-support/digital).

If you're not sure if your device has been compromised, read "Is my computer infected" under [Malware] (umbrella://lesson/malware)?
