Phishing is a form of social engineering, an attack which exploits human psycology to gain access to something confidential. An attacker without the skills or resources to break encryption, for example, could easily pick up the phone and pretend to be a systems administrator in order to convince someone to share their password. (Never share your password, by the way.)   

Social engineering can happen online or offline—anywhere from a dating site to a bar. But attackers take advantage of all the personal information we share on social media to conduct social engineering. (Learn more about [Social Media] (umbrella://lesson/social media).) 

Here are a few key tips to help limit your exposure on platforms like Facebook:

*   Never become friends with someone you don't actually know, even if you appear to have friends in common.
*   Be cautious of the groups you join. Don't share anything in a private group that you wouldn't share publicly. Don't click on links or attachments posted in the group by members you don't know.
*   Be suspicious of messages that ask for any type of sensitive or personal information.
*   Don't share personal information that you use to answer security questions, like your date of birth or where you went to school. (Learn to answer security questions better under [Passwords] (umbrella://lesson/passwords).)
