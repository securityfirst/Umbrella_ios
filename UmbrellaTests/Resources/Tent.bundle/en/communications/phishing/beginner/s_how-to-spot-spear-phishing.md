title: How to Spot Spear Phishing
---
# Targeted attacks are called spear phishing. 

These attackers research the target and design messages specifically to trick one individual or community. Spear phishing messages can be difficult to spot, but attackers still make small, telltale mistakes. 

Whether this is a problem for you will depend on your threat model.

If you might be at risk of attack, or you communicate with others who might be at risk: 

## Be cautious of any unexpected message. 

*	Even from someone you trust.  
*	Especially with attachments and links. 

## Check the tone.

If someone you know falls victim to a phishing attack, the attacker may use their account to contact you over email, social media, or chat. 
 
		*	Does your friend sound like themselves? 
		*	Do they make unexpected mistakes? 

*If a trusted account is compromised, your instinct may be the only thing that stops you from clicking on a bad link.*   
 
## Contact the sender.

*	Always check if a suspicious message is real. 
*	Make contact through a different channel to prevent the attacker from responding. 

For example, call or send a secure chat message to check a suspicious email. Doing so has helped people avoid some of the most elaborate spear phishing attacks.
