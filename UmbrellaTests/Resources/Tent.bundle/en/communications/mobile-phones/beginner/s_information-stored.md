## Use CameraV

Photos and videos you take on your phone include metadata. Metadata can reveal the identity and location of your device. 

Metadata supports the credibility of images and video used as evidence. But metadata can also put you or others at risk. 

[CameraV](https://guardianproject.info/apps/camerav/) is a plugin for ObscuraCam. 

CameraV can: 

*	Store media with valuable metadata securely; 
*	Strip metadata from images and video to share on social media.
