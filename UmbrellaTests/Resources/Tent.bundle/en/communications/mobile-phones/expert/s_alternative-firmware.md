# Alternative Firmware

Rooting your phone will allow you to install alternative firmware, however it may increase other risks.

An example of an alternative firmware for some Android phones is [Lineage OS](https://www.lineageos.org/) or [Copperhead OS](https://copperhead.co) which allow greater control over your phone. For example they make it easier to uninstall applications from the system level of your phone. By doing so, you can reduce the number of ways in which your device can be monitored, such as data that is sent to your service provider without your knowledge. This sort of alternative firmware includes features such as the automatic concealment of your location when online by using a Virtual Private Network as default, and automatic incognito browsing meaning history of your communication is not recorded on your smartphone.
