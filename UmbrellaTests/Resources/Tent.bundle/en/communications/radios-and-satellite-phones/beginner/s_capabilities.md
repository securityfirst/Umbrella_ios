# Radio sets should have: 

##	Remote diagnostics

One unit can interrogate another to get details on operational factors such as power output, signal strength and battery voltage. 

This allows a technician who is not physically present to diagnose potential impediments.

##	Emergency calls

Distress signals can be automatically sent out to a number of pre-programmed stations, prioritising the urgency of the call for the receiver.

## Consider GPS

A GPS connected to a personal computer with tracking software installed can interrogate a GPS connected to a mobile unit without the occupants of the vehicle being aware that this is happening. Vehicle movements can thus be monitored. 

Carefully consider the risks of others monitoring such tracking software before applying it.
