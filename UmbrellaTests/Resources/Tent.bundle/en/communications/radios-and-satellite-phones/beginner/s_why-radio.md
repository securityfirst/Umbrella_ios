title: Why Radio
---
# Radios are insecure and conspicuous. 

For sensitive communication, choose something more secure if possible. 

(Learn more about [sending a message] (umbrella://lesson/sending-a-message) and
[making a call](umbrella://lesson/making-a-call).) 

However, radios are generally robust and independent of public facilities, while telecommunications networks may be overloaded or shut down in a crisis.

If necessary, use an inconspicuous code for sensitive words.

*	Agree emergency code words with colleagues in advance.
