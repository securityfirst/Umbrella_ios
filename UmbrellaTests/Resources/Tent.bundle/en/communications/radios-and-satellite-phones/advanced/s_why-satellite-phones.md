# Satphones

*	High-quality, direct-dial voice, fax, and email.
*	Often supplement radio networks, especially in moderate- to high-risk areas. 
*	Rugged, portable, and may be cheaper to operate than mobile phones in some areas. 

_Note: 

Modern satellite phone networks encrypt voice traffic to prevent eavesdropping and so are usually thought of as safer than radios. However, anyone with cheap computer equipment and radio could easily break this encryption eavesdrop on calls._
