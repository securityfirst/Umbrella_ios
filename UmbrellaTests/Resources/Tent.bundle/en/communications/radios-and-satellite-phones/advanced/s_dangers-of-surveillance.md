# Weak encryption

Satellite transmissions are encrypted, but they are still not secure. 

Many governments are capable of defeating this encryption.

*   Avoid satellite phones entirely for sensitive communications.

*	Use code words in highly sensitive transmissions.

# Seizure

If your satellite phone is confiscated, authorities or hostile actors can access sensitive information.

*   Routinely delete sensitive information to protect your sources. Consider:

		*	Call logs; 
        *	Contacts; 
        *	Sent folders.

*	Keep the SIM card separate from the phone when not transmitting.
