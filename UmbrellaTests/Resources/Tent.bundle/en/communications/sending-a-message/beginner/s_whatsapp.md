# The most popular mobile communication tool in the world. 

WhatsApp offers free messaging to individuals and groups on a range of devices and operating systems. 

## End-to-end encryption

*	Between 2014 and 2016, WhatsApp integrated secure code from Open Whisper Systems, who build Signal;

*	WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted as long as all parties use the most recent version; WhatsApp cannot view or be forced to reveal the content. 

(Read WhatsApp's [security policy] (https://www.whatsapp.com/security/).)  

## Security considerations

*   WhatsApp does not encrypt pictures once they arrive on your phone.
*   WhatsApp can still access metadata, information that reveals that you are communicating with someone. In some cases, this may still have negative security consequences.
* 	An attacker may try to intercept WhatsApp communications by changing your contact's security code. Go to Settings > Account > Security > Show security notifications to switch on warnings about this activity. 
*	WhatsApp is owned by Facebook and shares at least some user data with the company.  

*We still recommend Signal for secure messaging and calls.* (Learn how to use Signal for [Android] (umbrella://lesson/signal-for-android) and [iOS] (umbrella://lesson/singal-for-ios).) 

## Turn on 2FA

Add security to your WhatsApp account by enabling two-step verification, a form of two-factor authentication (2FA).

(Learn about 2FA in [Passwords Advanced](umbrella://lesson/passwords/1))

*	Go to Settings > Account > Two-step verification > Enable.
*	Create a six-digit PIN. WhatsApp will periodically prompt you to enter it. 

WhatsApp will email a link to disable 2FA to users who provide an email address. Note: 

*	WhatsApp does not verify this email address. 
* 	If you skip this step and later receive an email to disable two-step verification, someone else could be attempting to register your phone number. *Do not click on the link.*
*	If you skip this step and later forget your PIN, WhatsApp will not allow you to reverify for seven days. You will lose all pending messages when you reverify. 
* 	If you reverify after 30 days, your old account will be deleted and replaced with a new one.
