title: Sending secure SMS on your phone
---
# Silence

[Silence](https://silence.im) is a free, open-source tool for sending and receiving secure SMS text messages on Android. 

*	It works both for encrypted and non-encrypted SMS, so you can use it as your default SMS application. 
*	It automatically imports all your contacts and existing SMS, so only takes a few seconds to set up. 
*	No internet connection is required. 
*	Silence encrypts SMS locally, so if your phone is lost or stolen, your messages are protected.

The person you are communicating with must also install Silence to encrypt SMS.

*Note: Many people who previously used TextSecure (now Signal) for secure SMS now use Silence (formerly SMSSecure).*
