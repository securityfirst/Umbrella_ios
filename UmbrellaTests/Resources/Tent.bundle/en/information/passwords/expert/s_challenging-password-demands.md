title: Challenging password demands
---
## Laws about revealing passwords vary. 

* In some jurisdictions you may be able to legally challenge a demand for your password. 

* In other jurisdictions local laws allow the government to demand information is given to them. 

* If you are crossing a border, authorities may delay you or seize your devices if you refuse to give up a password or unlock your device.

*Note: intentional destruction of evidence or obstruction of an investigation can be charged as a separate crime, often with very serious consequences. In some cases, this can be easier for the government to prove and allow for more substantial punishments than the alleged crime originally being investigated.*
