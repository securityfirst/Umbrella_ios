title: Threats of Physical Harm

# Attackers can threaten you with harm or detention to obtain your password. 

Decide if this is a possibility for you, for example, if you plan to cross a hostile border with sensitive information. 

(Learn more about assessing your own risk in the [managing information] (umbrella://lesson/managing-information) lesson.)

If so: 

## Hide secret accounts

Do not trust that you will never hand over the password. Consider how to hide the existence of the data or device you are protecting with a password.  

## Maintain a decoy

If you maintain an account with unimportant information on a computer, email service, or KeePassXC, you can reveal the password without exposing sensitive information.

## Check your device

Your devices are often configured to display your primary account, for example, on your computer login screen, or a tab that loads automatically in your web browser.  

If you are hiding an account or using a decoy, reconfigure your device accordingly.
