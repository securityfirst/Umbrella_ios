# Security questions are also passwords

## Answering honestly could allow attackers to bypass your password.

Many websites use security questions to confirm your identity if you forget your password:

*	What is your mother's maiden name?
*	What was your first pet's name? 

The real answers to these questions are often public information, or can be easily found. 

> *For example, you or family members may have public posts saying "Here is a photo of our first cat, Spot!"* 

## Make up the answers instead

*	Invent fictional answers that no one knows but you.

> *For example, instead of using "Spot" as your password recovery answer, you might choose "Rumplestiltskin."*

*	Use a password manager to store random answers.
