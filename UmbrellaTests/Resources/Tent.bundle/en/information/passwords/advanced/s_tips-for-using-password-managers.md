title: Tips for using password managers
---
## Back it up. 

If you lose or accidentally delete your only copy of a password database, you will lose access to your accounts. This makes it extremely important that you back up your KeePassXC database. (Learn more about [backing up](umbrella://lesson/backing-up).)

## Create a secure, memorable master password.

If you forget your KeePassXC master password, there is no way to recover it or the contents of the database. Make it secure and memorable!

## Keep it secure.

* **On your computer.** 

Your password manager is only as strong as the security of the device you use it on. If your device is compromised, an attacker could watch you type your master password and access all your accounts. Keep your device free of malware when using a password manager. (Learn how in the [Malware lesson](umbrella://lesson/malware).)

*  **In the cloud.** 

Some password managers store your passwords in the cloud, meaning passwords encrypted on a remote server are retrieved and decrypted when you need them on a mobile device. This is more convenient, but gives an attacker seeking access to your passwords another possible target. It's not usually a compromise you need to worry about unless your attacker has legal powers over the password manager company or is known for targeting companies or internet traffic.
