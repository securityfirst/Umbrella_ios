# One-time passwords

Some services, such as Google, also allow you to generate a list of one-time passwords, also called single-use passwords. These are meant to be printed or written down on paper and carried with you.

There is no way to do this by yourself if you're using a service that doesn't offer it.

If you or your organization runs your own communications infrastructure, such as your own e-mail servers, there's freely available software that can be used to enable two-step authentication for accessing your systems. Ask your systems administrators to look for software offering an implementations of the open standard "Time-Based One-Time Passwords" or RFC 6238.
