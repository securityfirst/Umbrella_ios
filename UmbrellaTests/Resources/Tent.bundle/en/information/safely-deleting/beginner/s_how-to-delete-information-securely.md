# Emptying the trash

Most of us think that a file on our computer is deleted once we put the file in our computer's trash or recycle bin and empty the trash. 

In reality, this does not actually delete files. It just makes them invisible until the space they took up on your computer is overwritten with something else. With the right tools, your "deleted" files can often be retrieved.

# Replace or overwrite

The best way to delete a file is to make sure it gets overwritten immediately. The method depends on your operating system.  

(Securely deleting data from solid state drives (SSDs), USB flash drives, and SD cards is almost impossible.)
