title: Secure deletion when discarding hardware

# Wipe hard drives

Wipe your hard drive before you throw your computer away, sell it on eBay, or stash an old machine in a closet.

Tools like [DBAN] (https://dban.org/) make this easy. There are a variety of tutorials on how to use it across the web, (including [here] (https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-erase-a-hard-drive-using-dban-2619148)).

# Shred CD-ROMS

Shred CD-ROMs, just like you do with paper. 

There are inexpensive shredders that will chew up CD-ROMs. Never just throw a CD-ROM out in the rubbish unless you're absolutely sure there's nothing sensitive on it.

# Encrypt SSDs, USB flash drives, and SD cards

Secure deletion is difficult, if not impossible, in these formats. 

Use encryption so that even if the file is still on the disk, it will at least look like gibberish to anyone without the key to decrypt it.
