# Accidental deletion

When you delete a file in on your computer, it may disappear, but its contents can be recovered.

(Learn more about [safely deleting](umbrella://lesson/safely-deleting). 

If you accidentally delete information, this security vulnerability can work to your advantage. 

# Recovery software

Several programs can restore access to recently deleted files, such as Recuva for Windows. 

TestDisk and PhotoRec by [CGSecurity] (www.cgsecurity.org/) offer free, open-source data recovery for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

(Learn how to use [Recuva] (umbrella://lesson/recuva) in our tool guide.)

# Recovery tips

## Do as little as possible with your computer after you delete a file by accident. 

*	The longer you use your computer before attempting to restore the file, the less likely you are to succeed. 

## Install recovery software *before* you need it! 

Or use the portable version of a program like Recuva. Don't install it for the first time *after* you delete an important file by accident.
