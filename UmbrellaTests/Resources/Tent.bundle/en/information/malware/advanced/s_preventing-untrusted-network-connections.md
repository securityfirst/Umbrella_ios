# Use a firewall

A firewall helps to: 

* 	Protect your computer from unauthorised connections to and from the Internet. 
* 	Reduce the spread of malware if you are infected.  

## Most operating systems have firewalls included, but: 

* Check to make sure they are turned on. 

(You can usually find this under Control Panel > Security.) 

* Use additional firewall software. 

Excellent free programs, such as [Comodo](https://personalfirewall.comodo.com/free-download.html?track=5560) personal firewall, can help keep your computer secure. (Learn how to use it [here.] (https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/comodo/windows/))

* Make sure that all of the computers on your office network have a firewall installed.
