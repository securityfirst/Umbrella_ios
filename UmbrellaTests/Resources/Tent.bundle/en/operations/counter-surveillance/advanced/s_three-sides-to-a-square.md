title: Three Sides of a Square
---
# 4 sides, 3 stops

Make your route more complicated and invent reasons to stop, in order to:  

*	Identify watchers; 
*	Make it harder for them to follow you.  

Try this alone or with a team.

## Move in a square instead of a line

1.	To get from A to B, add C and D. In other words, make at least 3 unscheduled turns.

2.	Make at least 3 unscheduled stops to observe 3 sides of the square.  

## Reasons to stop

Invent reasons to stop or change direction that:

*	Are credible. 

Don't alert watchers that you are checking for surveillance by repeatedly stopping for the same reason. 

*   Force watchers to follow you.

If you enter a building, make it hard for watchers to see what you are doing, and easier for you to spot them.  

*   Allow you to look around or monitor entrances;

*	Allow you to move quickly. 

Pay up front and avoid ordering hot food.
