Look out for people who are:

## Equipped for surveillance

*   Wearing comfortable or outdoor clothing and footwear;
*   Carrying personal equipment, such as:
	*	Sports or smart watch;
	*	Communications device, including an earpiece or radio switch. 

## Easily overlooked 

*   Women (many people expect surveillance to be conducted by men);
*   In couples or groups;
*   Wearing expensive clothes;
*   Younger or older;
*   Jogging or dog walking;
*   Homeless or begging;
*   Service staff in hotels, restaurants, or parks;
*   Maintenance or construction workers;
*   Driving delivery vehicles;
*   Minorities (for example, from an ethnic group not common in the local area)
*   Pushing a pram, or carrying shopping bags. 

## Behaving differently

*   Adjusting personal equipment;
*   Touching an earpiece;
*   Talking into a device;
*   Unusually distracted or concentrated;
*   Behaving unusually;
*   Trying to avoid the target;
*   Looking around corners or through windows;
*   Mirroring the target's behaviour;
*   Stopping in unusual places. 

## Working in teams

If you suspect one person of conducting surveillance, watch them to identify others. 

One person can cross-contaminate another team member by:

*   Speaking to them;
*   Looking in their direction;
*   Using hand signals;
*   Behaving or dressing in a similar manner.
