*	Ensure you can pay the fare. 
*	Sit at the back to observe who follows.
*	Sit where you can observe other vehicles overtaking.
*	For covert counter-surveillance, switch to a second bus going a different way to make it look like you are lost.
*	For overt anti-surveillance, get off at the next stop, and rapidly get on another bus.

Trains are faster than other vehicles, making them hard to follow.  

*	Try to be the last passenger on the train. 
*	Stand at the end of the platform to observe other passengers.

*	For covert counter-surveillance, switch to a second train going a different way to make it look like you are lost.
