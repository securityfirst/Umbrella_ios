title: Five Rules of Counter-Surveillance
---
## 1 is the trigger

The trigger: 
*	Alerts the surveillance team when the target is on the move. 
*	Is the easiest member of the team to identify.

## 10 to 2

*	Your eyeline falls between 10 and 2 on an imaginary clock face. 
*	Surveillance teams try to avoid your eyeline.

## 3 sightings

Look for 3 repeat sightings of the same unexpected person to confirm that you are under surveillance.

## 4 sides, 3 stops

Filter out coincidental sightings on 3 sides of a square.

*	Make 3 unscheduled turns (move in a square instead of a line).   
*	Make unscheduled stops on 3 sides of the square.  

## 5 breaks the box

Surveillance teams may surround you by positioning themselves on the corners of an imaginary box. Keeping you in the box makes you easier to follow, because it covers all possible directions you might move in. 

*	Strike out in an unexpected direction to break the box.
*	Watch for the team to make mistakes while they adapt.
