# Choke points

Choke points are slow to pass through, and make it more likely that a watcher will expose their position.  

Pass through a choke point to observe who follows you.  

## Naturally occurring choke points 

*   Narrow lanes or alleys;
*   Quiet roads;
*   Long, straight roads;
*   Traffic lights;
*   Roundabouts;
*   Road junctions;
*   One-way streets;
*   Car parks;
*   Toll booths;
*   Road works.

Avoid choke points that may represent a security risk.

# Handovers

A surveillance team using more than one vehicle may switch off. Choke points and stops are opportunities for a handover.  

If you are working in a team, or it is safe to observe:

*	Note up to 10 of the vehicles that follow the target through a choke point. 

*	When turning, look for possible watchers who continue straight.

*	Look for 3 repeat sightings of the same vehicle.
