## Understand the situation

*	Communicate with the person who was arrested as soon as you can.
*	Find out from them exactly what is happening.

## Protect their rights

Insist on your team member's rights to be:

*	Visited; 
*	Given medical and legal assistance;
*	Well treated and kept in acceptable conditions;
*	Released if not charged within a specified timeframe. 

Protest if these requests are not met. 

## Seek their release

The arrest may relate to the person's actions or the organisation they work for.

Your first goal is to work towards their safe and speedy release. 

After that is obtained, consider whether you need to restore the reputation of the person or the team.
