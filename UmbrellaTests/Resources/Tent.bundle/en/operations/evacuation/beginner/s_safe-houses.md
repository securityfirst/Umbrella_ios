Safe houses may be:

*	Spaces rented specifically for emergencies;
*	Spaces already being used by friendly people (safe havens).

# Choosing a safe house

## Neighbourhood

Choose a community:

*	Where you are likely to be anonymous and not raise suspicion;
*	That is unlikely to inform on activity in the safe house.

## Approach

Choose a building with: 

*	Oversight over approaches and entrances. 
*	Emergency escape routes which are known to team members. 
*	Secure parking to prevent others accessing your vehicle or placing a tracker. 

(Learn more about this in [counter-surveillance](umbrella://lesson/counter-surveillance/2).)

## Security and comfort

Choose a space with: 

*	Locks on windows, doors and gates.
*	A quality alarm system, or a dog if appropriate. 
*	Appropriate water, heating and electricity.

## Maintenance

*	Pay rent and bills in cash to avoid leaving a paper trail.  
*	Arrange for empty safe houses to be serviced to avoid suspicion (collect mail, cut grass). 
*	Arrange activity for empty safe houses to make them look occupied. 

## Equipment

Consider:

*   Fuel, food, batteries and water to last everyone in it at least ten days;
*   An emergency generator;
*   Battery-powered or wind-up mechanical radio;
*   Clothing, especially weather-proof outerwear;
*   Advanced first aid kit with extra medications as required;
*   Flashlights with extra batteries;
*   Maps, emergency evacuation procedures;
*   Mobile phones with top-up credit and chargers; 
*   Satellite phone and charger if needed; 
*   Sufficient cash;
*   Items to reduce stress (e.g. books, magazines, TV, board games, games consoles etc.)

## Waste

Shred, burn, or destroy waste that may reveal information about you or the safe house.

Consider:

*	Documents;
*	Ticket stubs; 
*	Receipts;
*	Electronic waste;
*	General waste which reveals the number of people using the house or what they are doing.
