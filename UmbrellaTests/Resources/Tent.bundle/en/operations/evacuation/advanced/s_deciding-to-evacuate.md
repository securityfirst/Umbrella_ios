title: Deciding to evacuate

# Do the risks outweigh the benefits?

Deciding to evacuate is difficult, and there is no formula.

*	Take advice;
*	Use your judgement. 
*	Consider lesser measures first. 

Ask yourself: 

*	Is the situation expected to worsen?
*	Is the current situation untenable? 

Remember evacuation may expose staff to danger.  

_Evacuation may be forced if you are expelled by the government._

## Complications

It may be tempting to stay if:

*	You provide an important service. 
*	Local people are in danger because of the security situation.
*	You may monitor or witness deteriorating conditions.  

It may be tempting to delay if: 

*	You need approval to evacuate or return. 
*	You need to finish a project or report to a donor.
*	Team members disagree about the risk or want to stay.
*	Leaving could undermine acceptance of your work.

### Delay is a high-risk strategy

*	It may become impossible to leave.
*	A serious security incident may force you to leave, making return harder.

## Self-evacuation 

*	If you are in a remote area or are isolated during a crisis, use your judgement and evacuate if your safety is threatened.  

*	Communicate with your team or outside support.
