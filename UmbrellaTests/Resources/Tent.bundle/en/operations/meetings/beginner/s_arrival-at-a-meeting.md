## Practise counter-surveillance

*	Remove phone batteries before you arrive to avoid being tracked. 

(Learn more about this in [mobile phones](umbrella://lesson/mobile-phones))

*	Practise counter-surveillance en route. Ensure you are clear before you arrive. 

(Learn about [counter-surveillance](umbrella://lesson/counter-surveillance/0).) 

## Check the meeting place

*	Arrive first to check for possible surveillance;
*	Survey approaches, entrance, exits, and toilets;
*	Do not buy anything or unpack until you are sure you are clear;
*	Be prepared to switch to your alternate location at the last minute if there is a problem. 

## Monitor the meeting place

*	Sit where you can see the rest of the space;
*	Sit with your back to a wall; 
*	Sit near the exit or identify an escape route.

## Observe other people

*	Observe people who enter after the person you are meeting;
*	Observe anyone who sits close to you;
*	Look for indicators of a surveillance team.

## Collaborate 

Team members who do not need to participate can arrive separately. 

*	Don't indicate that you know each other. 
*	Position them nearby to check for surveillance. 
*	Ask them to signal if there is a problem or they can overhear your conversation. 
*	If a participant at risk is not counter-surveillance trained, ask a team member to check for surveillance.
