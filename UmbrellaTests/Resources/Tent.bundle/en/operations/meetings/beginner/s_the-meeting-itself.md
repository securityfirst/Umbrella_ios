## If ordering food

*	Choose something small. Avoid long meals;
*	Pay in cash to protect your identity;
*	Pay up front if you can to leave quickly.
*	Do not let service staff overhear your meeting.

## Stay alert

*	Continue to monitor the meeting place
*	Trust your instincts;
*	Be prepared to leave immediately if something is not right.

## Share security strategies

If participants are not already briefed: 

*	Raise security early, after introductions;
*	Agree an alternate time and meeting place if plans change;
*	Agree a discreet signal to alert others if something is wrong;
*	Convey what you can and cannot do to help if there is a problem; 
*	Control discussion and use time efficiently. 

## Protect information 

*	Ask for digital publications, links, or emails instead of paper;

(Learn about [email](umbrella://lesson/email/1).) 

*	If notes are necessary, use codes that only you understand to obscure names or other sensitive information. Try not to write anything sensitive in the first ten minutes. 

*	Protect sensitive recordings and files;

(Learn about [Protecting Files] (umbrella://lesson/protecting-files).)  

*	Destroy sensitive notes in a neutral location.
