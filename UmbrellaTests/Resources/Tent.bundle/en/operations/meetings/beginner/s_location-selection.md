# Choose the area 

*	All participants, or at least one, should know and feel comfortable in the area. 
*	Get to know new areas and meeting places in advance. 

Plan:
*	Your approach;
*	Possible escape routes;
*	Nearby safe spots such as partner offices, supportive local people, or embassies;

*   A cover story for borders or checkpoints.

# Choose a meeting place

*	If participants may be surveillance targets, avoid homes, hotels, offices, and other frequented locations.  
*	Choose a neutral public place, such as a café. 
*	Choose somewhere easy to fit in.
*	Avoid places known to attract certain groups or people at risk. 
*	Look for images and information online if you can't go in advance.
*	Open spaces make eavesdropping harder, but may also make it harder to fit in.

Consider:

*   Who goes there?
*   What do they wear?
*   What size groups do they sit in?
*   Are tables close together so you might be overheard?
*   Is it likely to be crowded?
*   Will going there attract notice or suspicion?

## Have a backup

*	Choose an alternate meeting place nearby.
*	Agree a discreet signal to alert others if something is wrong.
