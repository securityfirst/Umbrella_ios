# Should You Bring Your Phone?

Phones help you organise protests, as well as document them and communicate in an emergency.

(Learn more about this in [protests beginner](umbrella://lesson/protests/0).)

But taking your phone to a protest could: 

*	Reveal you are there;
*	Undermine your privacy in case of loss, theft, or detention. 

## Assess your risk

*	Your phone contains private data (contacts, photos, location data, and browsing history). 

(Learn more about this in [mobile phones](umbrella://lesson/mobile-phones/0).)

*	Stored passwords or apps in use may allow someone with access to the device to obtain more information from remote servers. 

*	Some countries require people to register SIM card or mobile phone purchases. 

*	Companies that run mobile phone networks can monitor your location, and many are required to share this information with governments.

If you take your mobile phone with you to a protest, it makes it easy for the government to figure out that you are there. 

**To conceal your presence, do not take a phone.**

**If you must take a phone, prepare carefully.**
