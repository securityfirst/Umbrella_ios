# At the Protest

## Use secure tools

*   **To communicate:**  

Law enforcement may be monitoring communications. Encrypt your messages by using Signal for [Android](umbrella://lesson/signal-for-android) or [iOS](umbrella://lesson/signal-for-ios).) 

Even if your messages are encrypted, any phone you use will broadcast your location and other metadata that reveals who you are talking to and for how long.

(Learn about [sending a message](umbrella://lesson/sending-a-message).) 

*   **To share photos and videos:** 

Protect privacy on social media. Blur faces with [ObscuraCam](umbrella://lesson/obscuracam) and strip (or securely preserve) revealing metadata from images with [CameraV](https://guardianproject.info/apps/camerav/).

(Learn more about this in [social media](umbrella://lesson/social-media/0).)
