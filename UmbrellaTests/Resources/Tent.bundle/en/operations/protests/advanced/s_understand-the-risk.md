Your legal rights vary depending on where you are. 

## Passwords 

*	Know the law before police ask you to unlock your device or accounts. 

*	If you decide to refuse, politely ask to speak to a lawyer instead. 

Even if refusing is your legal right, police may delay you, seize the device, or accuse you of obstruction, which may be a more serious crime than protesting.

## Masks

Covering your face helps you protect your identity in pictures and video.

*	Know the law about masks and if wearing them could get you into trouble. 

## Filming

Documenting protests may discourage police misconduct, but whether filming will get you into trouble depends on where you are.

*	Know the law about recording video.
