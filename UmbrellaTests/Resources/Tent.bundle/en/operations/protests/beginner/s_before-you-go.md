# Witnessing protests

Protest marches, rallies or unplanned gatherings may be small and self-limiting, or they may escalate and turn into a riot.

Journalists and civilians should prepare before observing or covering protests.

(Learn about organising or participating in protests in [protests advanced](umbrella://lesson/protests/1).)

## Preparation

Your preparations will depend on you, your team, and the event itself. 

Consider: 

*   **Emergency plans**

	*	When to pull out;
    *	Emergency meeting points.

_Remember: telecommunications networks and mobile apps may be overloaded or shut down in a crisis._

*   **Clothing and equipment**

	*	Wear comfortable or outdoor clothing and footwear to move fast, even if there is debris. 
    *	Avoid colours associated with protesters or police.
